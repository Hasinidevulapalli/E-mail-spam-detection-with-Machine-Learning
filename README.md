# üìß Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

## üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify emails as **spam** or **not spam** (ham). Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to train a spam filter that can detect unwanted and potentially harmful messages automatically.

## üîç Steps Performed

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Loaded the email dataset containing labeled messages (spam or ham).

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned text data (removed stopwords, punctuation, and lowercase conversion).
   - Tokenized and vectorized messages using TF-IDF.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized word frequencies in spam vs. ham emails.
   - Checked class distribution and text length patterns.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Used classification algorithms like:
     - Naive Bayes  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
